## 🧺 Directions

We'll be at Tables #13-#18 in Hellman Hollow! That's the most southwestern corner of that area.

If arriving by bike/feet/rollerblades/longboard/unicycle, you probably don't need directions, you do you!

The 5/7 buses are good options for public transportation. They'll drop you off on the park's borders and you can walk in.

This is an area of the park immediately west of the section of JFK that's closed to cars. If driving, plan on parking on Tranverse / Crossover Drive, or further west on JFK.

### 🥧  What should I bring?

Yourself! If you're local, bring something to sit on (lawn chair / blanket). We'll have plenty of extras for travellers or if you forget. 

We'll be providing lunch and drinks for everybody. If you're excited about making a celebratory dessert, let us know in the registration form.

<br />

### 🙋 Can I help?

Absolutely! Checkout the registration form for ideas or reach out to us directly.

<br />

### 👪 Can I bring a +1? Children? Dog? My +1's child's dog?

Yes. Just let us know who to expect in the registration form.

<br />

### 🧥 What should I wear?

Dress code wise, come as you are. But we'd be remiss if we didn't remind you that this is a foggy area of the city. Bring layers and expect wind.

<br />

### 💍  Whoa, you're getting married?

Yes! We were planning to have an SF City Hall wedding in April 2020, but ...
